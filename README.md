# Balls Render
Port of [Balls Render Processing](https://github.com/CharlotteCross1998/balls-render-processing) to Raylib.

# Building
1. `git clone https://github.com/CharlotteCross1998/Balls-Render-Raylib.git`
2. `make`

# Contributing

This code is meant to be as an example for others to build on, however I will accept contributions that fix bugs or add features that may extend the program, for example, adding attraction when balls are in a close enough range to create the triangle.
